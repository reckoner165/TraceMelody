# The SoundModule is a library of functions designed to perform real-time signal processing on blocks of audio.
# Each function takes inputs and outputs in a similar fashion, hence allowing them to
# be aggregated into a signal chain in an ad-hoc fashion.
# The various functions currently available in Sound-Module were developed keeping in mind
# their use in building the aesthetics necessary for SERIAL.
