# TraceMelody

TraceMelody is the working title for the project SERIAL

## SERIAL
SERIAL is a wirelessly connected network instrument, setup as a site-specific installation or a performance companion, which monitors activity in a given network space to generate melodies and timbres that draw from the era of serialism. The composition of this music is informed in real-time by network meta-data.

SERIAL is an attempt to create a sonic footprint of the internet that seeks to not only make people cognizant of the extent to which communication has been delegated to machines, but also present the amorphous character of a computer network as a collective organic being that engages in redundant behavior from time to time.

##Build 

1. Create a local clone in a system with Python version 2.7.10
2. Install tshark and pyshark (Python wrapper for sniffing using tshark framework)
Linux:
`pip install tshark` 

Building in Mac OS:
`brew install wireshark`

Install PyShark from here: http://kiminewt.github.io/pyshark/

3. Install pyaudio (a python wrapper around PortAudio)
`pip install PyAudio`

This is a work in progress. Build and interfacing methods will be updated from time to time.
